pyodbc (for querying sql server db from python):
https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki

some connection details (driver is my ubuntu specific):
  driver=ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server
  server=localhost
  uid=sa
  pwd=sqlPa$$123

some useful sql commands:
  list of tables in sys.tables (select name from sys.tables)
  list of databases in sys.databases  (select name from sys.databases)
  create databases and drop them in the same way as tables
